#   Title: RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION (RFID) WITH FINGERPRINT LOCK FOR SECURITY SYSTEMS.
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a safe door lock system incorporating Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and fingerprint recognition technology. The primary purpose is to strengthen access control security by implementing a dual-authentication system, ensuring only authorized users may get entry.
The system comprises an RFID module, a fingerprint sensor, a microprocessor, an electronic lock, and an LCD display. The RFID module reads RFID tags, while the fingerprint sensor takes and verifies fingerprint data. The microprocessor processes the signals from these sensors and regulates the electronic lock. The LCD display gives user feedback throughout the authentication procedure.
Upon initialization, the system prompts users to scan their RFID cards. If the card ID matches the authorized list, the user is then required to produce a fingerprint. Successful fingerprint verification results in the door unlocking, whereas failure in either phase prevents access. This two-step verification approach considerably bolsters security by assuring that possession of a valid RFID card alone is insufficient for entrance.
The project covers hardware design, software development, and integration of all components. The implementation is evaluated by unit and integration testing, ensuring reliability and user-friendliness. Future developments could involve integrating mobile applications for remote monitoring and introducing new biometric authentication techniques.
This dual-authentication system offers a realistic and successful method for strengthening security in diverse situations, including residential, commercial, and industrial applications.
